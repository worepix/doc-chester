If you want to have your recorded values easily accessible online, Google Sheets may be a good solution. Let's find out how you can do that!

.. note::

    **Limits of Google Sheets**

    Google Sheets have limit of up to 5 milions cells, but that will take a while to fill up.

We will use the `CO2 Monitor Kit <https://www.hackster.io/jakub-smejkal/radio-co2-monitor-311d2c>`_ as an example, but you can easily modify the code to any module,
from which you want to save data.
