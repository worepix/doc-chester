Example commands
****************

Get some inspiration for things you can say!

**Hey Google:**

- Turn on the Power Controller
- Turn off relay on Power Controller
- Set the color to red
- What is the Push Button battery level?
- Set the brightness to 50%
- Lower the brightness
- What is the temperature of Push Button
- What is the humidity of Climate Monitor
- Turn on the Push Button
- Disarm the Motion Detector
- Turn on the Radio Dongle (starts pairing mode)

******
Scenes
******

Use a scene node to create custom commands that you can activate using Google Assistant.

Set up the Scene node with Scene config and connect it to either MQTT node or as an input to Voice node.

.. image:: ../_static/integrations/google_assistant/scene_setup.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 51%

Fill out the Scene node config:

.. image:: ../_static/integrations/google_assistant/scene_config.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 51%

Save the changes to the config and press **Deploy**

Now you can use the button left to the Scene node to send the update.

.. image:: ../_static/integrations/google_assistant/setup_updated.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 51%

Your node is node updated and you can activate it by saying *"Hey Google, activate {scene name}"* if you choose to make it reversible,
different commands will be sent by saying *"Hey Google, deactivate {scene name}"*

Dynamic scenes
**************

You can set up dynamic scenes, which are set based on some conditions in real-time.
You can do this by importing the following nodes as an example.

.. image:: ../_static/integrations/google_assistant/scene_dynamic.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 51%

.. code-block:: json

    [{"id":"47e1ca7.8849d34","type":"inject","z":"8a5b93d7.0fff5","name":"Update scene","topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"x":376,"y":217.00000667572021,"wires":[["c8b3c85d.965198"]]},{"id":"c8b3c85d.965198","type":"function","z":"8a5b93d7.0fff5","name":"Dynamic scene","func":"msg.topic = \"node/testScene/scene/-/set\";\nmsg.payload = {\n    name: \"Test scene\",\n    id: \"testScene\", //id must match id in topic\n    alias: \"testScene\",\n    nicknames: [\n        \"Test scene\",\n        \"Testing scene\"\n        ],\n    commands: [\n        {\n            topic: \"node/power-controller:0/led-strip/-/color/set\",\n            payload: '\"#ffffff(00)\"'\n        }\n        ],\n    reverseCommands: [\n        {\n            topic: \"node/power-controller:0/led-strip/-/color/set\",\n            payload: '\"#000000(00)\"'\n        }\n        ],\n    reversible: true\n}\nmsg.payload = JSON.stringify(msg.payload);\nreturn msg;","outputs":1,"noerr":0,"x":565.0000953674316,"y":217.0000467300415,"wires":[["c4a9ef46.d553"]]}]

Other
*****

Filter send messages
********************

Use the **Switch node** for any messages that you don't want to be sent to the Google Assistant.
Place the switch node between the MQTT out and Google Assistant node and connect just the first output to the Google Assistant node.

Fill out all the message topics that you don't want to be sent.

.. image:: ../_static/integrations/google_assistant/filter.PNG
   :align: center
   :scale: 51%

Change the number of batteries
******************************

As default we use the number of batteries that were provided in the Kit,
if you have changed for example the `Mini Battery Module <https://shop.hardwario.com/mini-battery-module/>`_ (2x AAA)
to `Battery Module <https://shop.hardwario.com/battery-module/>`_,
you can update Google Assistant with following MQTT message,
this will ensure that you get correct responses.

.. code-block::
    :linenos:

    {
        payload: 2, // 2 or 4
        topic: `node/{moduleId}/batteries/-/set`,
    }

Rename your modules
*******************

Use the Google Home app to change the default names to something you like.

Or you can use custom MQTT message to rename the module using Node-RED:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:

    {
        payload: "New name",
        topic: `node/{moduleId}/name/-/set`,
    }

Motion Detector setup
*********************

You can arm/disarm the `Motion Detector <https://shop.hardwario.com/motion-detector-kit/>`_ using Google Assistant. It will send the following MQTT message:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:

    {
        payload: true, // true or false
        topic: `node/motion-detector:0/pir/-/armed`,
    }

You can use this message to create conditions and flow to limit the Motion Detector.

Feel free to modify the example you can get from **Menu -> Import -> Examples -> Package name -> Alarm example**
