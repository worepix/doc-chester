Basic Principles
################

**Modular hardware** is the essence of the **HARDWARIO IoT Kit**.
We put a lot of effort into the quality of our products.
That's why we source all the components from the official distributors and manufacture all our products locally, in Europe.

However, the product quality is not just about experience with the sourcing and manufacturing processes,
but it all starts with a proper engineering design. We spend endless amount of hours on proper component selection,
peer-reviewed schematic design and precise PCB routing that does not only contribute to the overall product reliability, but also looks beautiful.

ECAD Software

All hardware design is done using **EAGLE** from **Autodesk**.
We use **EAGLE** because it is cross-platform, easy-to-use and features open XML file format,
which perfectly fits for the Git version control system and team workflow.

You will find released schematic and assembly drawings in our GitHub repository `bc-hardware <https://github.com/hardwario/bc-hardware>`_.

Enclosures

We also design and maintain the whole range of 3D enclosures that are optimized for 3D printing.
