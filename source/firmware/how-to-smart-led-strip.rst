How to: Smart LED Strip
#######################

Our `Smart LED Strips <https://shop.hardwario.com/led/>`_ provides you easy way to show values like temperature as a color range, blinking etc.

You need to use a `Power Module <https://shop.hardwario.com/power-module/>`_ which takes care of power and communication between Core module and the LED strip.

.. tip::

    **If you need cool white light only**

    ...you can use standard 5V white LED strip connected to the relay on the Power Module.

There are some functions available in SDK which can "do things" with your LED strip - changing color to imitate rainbow,
representing temperate or some score, etc... But they are not yet commented which means you can not find them in the SDK documentation.
You can find them directly in `SDK on Github <https://github.com/hardwario/bcf-sdk/blob/master/bcl/inc/bc_led_strip.h>`_ or in this article (some of them).

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- In examples bellow we expect that the variable ``bc_led_strip_t led_strip;`` is instantiated and available for all code.
- Remember that single LED is called a *pixel* in this document an so as in the SDK

***********
Basic Usage
***********

Available colors
****************

LEDs featured on our strip are **RGBW**. Which means they include separate light source for Red, Green, Blue and White (warm white) colors.

.. note::

    To get almost cool white light, you have to set every single color to the same value as the other ones.

Initialization
**************

First you have to instantiate a variables with type ``bc_led_strip_t`` and ``bc_led_strip_buffer_t`` somewhere in your code.

The buffer is de facto a place where you tell the SDK how your LED strip looks like. This is an example for our 144 LEDs strip:

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    const bc_led_strip_buffer_t _led_strip_buffer =
            {
                    .type = BC_LED_STRIP_TYPE_RGBW,
                    .count = 144,
                    .buffer = _dma_buffer
            };

Initialization of power module WITH LED strip connected is achieved by calling these function inside *application_init*:

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    bc_module_power_init();
    bc_led_strip_init(&led_strip, bc_module_power_get_led_strip_driver(), &_led_strip_buffer);

Writing Changes and Reading the State
*************************************

Like with the LCD module you have to write every change you make (change color of one led, change brightness, ...).
You can write changes by calling ``bc_led_strip_write(&led_strip)``

You can also find out if the LED strip is ready for making changes/going to next step of programmed process.
Just call this function, which returns bool: ``bc_led_strip_is_ready(&led_strip)``.

Number of Pixels
****************

If you are not sure how many pixels your LED strip has, there is no need to count them one by one. Just call function, which return the count as an ``int`` value:

.. code-block:: c

    int pixels = bc_led_strip_get_pixel_count(&led_strip);

Set One Pixel at a Time
***********************

The most basic thing you can do is to set the color for every pixel at a time. To do this, you need to use function

``bc_led_strip_set_pixel_rgbw(bc_led_strip_t *self, int position, uint8_t r, uint8_t g, uint8_t b, uint8_t w)``

**Parameters**:

- ``*self`` - pointer to instantiated LED strip (in our example it is ``&led_strip``)
- ``position`` - pixel which should change the color, starting from 0 (not 1)
- ``r, g, b, w`` - representation of how strongly every color should shine, values must be between 0 and 255

Example
*******

This code will switch on 35 LEDs, making them brighter 5 points per LED (0 to 175). Blue color was chosen.

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #include <bcl.h>

    bc_led_strip_t led_strip;
    static uint32_t _dma_buffer[144 * 4 * 2]; // count * type * 2
    const bc_led_strip_buffer_t _led_strip_buffer =
            {
                    .type = BC_LED_STRIP_TYPE_RGBW,
                    .count = 144,
                    .buffer = _dma_buffer
            };

    void application_init(void)
    {
        bc_module_power_init();
        bc_led_strip_init(&led_strip, bc_module_power_get_led_strip_driver(), &_led_strip_buffer);

        uint8_t blue = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 35; ++i) {
            bc_led_strip_set_pixel_rgbw(&led_strip, i, 0, 0, blue, 0);
            blue += 5;
        }

        bc_led_strip_write(&led_strip);
    }

LED Brightness
**************

You can limit maximum brightness of the entire led strip with function ``bc_led_strip_set_brightness(bc_led_strip_t *self, uint8_t brightness)``.

Always remember that the brightness needs to be set before lighting up any LEDs. If you set it after making any changes, nothing will happen.

*******
Effects
*******

There are several effect functions available. Let's see them in action.

Every effect bellow has an example of use. This will work for our 144 LEDs strip (other may need slight changes in the skeleton app below).
You can copy every single example at the end of application_init function from this skeleton:

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #include <bcl.h>

    bc_led_strip_t led_strip;
    static uint32_t _dma_buffer[144 * 4 * 2]; // count * type * 2
    const bc_led_strip_buffer_t _led_strip_buffer =
            {
                    .type = BC_LED_STRIP_TYPE_RGBW,
                    .count = 144,
                    .buffer = _dma_buffer
            };

    void application_init(void)
    {
        bc_module_power_init();
        bc_led_strip_init(&led_strip, bc_module_power_get_led_strip_driver(), &_led_strip_buffer);

        // place examples here

    }

Rainbow Effect
**************

LED strip will light up in color of a rainbow and will fluently change these colors in circles (what ends on one side of the strip starts on the other side).

.. code-block:: c

    bc_led_strip_effect_rainbow_cycle(&led_strip, 100);

.. note::

    The second parameter represents speed of changes. Lower number = quicker changes

There is also a function ``bc_led_strip_effect_rainbow`` which acts almost the same, but it takes a while
before color appears on one end of a strip after disappearing from another.

Color Wipe Effect
*****************

Fills the entire strip pixel by pixel with one color. Just use this function:

.. code-block:: c

    bc_led_strip_effect_color_wipe(&led_strip, 0x10000000, 20);

The first parameter takes a color in hex format (this particular is red color) and the second parameter is speed. The lower, the quicker.

Theater Effect
**************

Cause the LEDs to switch in pattern shown bellow: - means that LED is off, **X** means that LED is on.

Pattern:

X--X--X--X--X--X
-X--X--X--X--X--
--X--X--X--X--X-
X--X--X--X--X--X

To trigger this effect, just call a function:

.. code-block:: c

    bc_led_strip_effect_theater_chase(&led_strip, 0x10000000, 100);

The first parameter is a color in HEX format (stored in ``uint32_t``), the second one is a speed of changes.

Effect Stop
***********

You can easily stop the effect (before starting another one, for example) with this function:

.. code-block:: c

    bc_led_strip_effect_stop(&led_strip);

Here is a full code example of stopping the effect three seconds after starting it.

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #include <bcl.h>

    bc_led_strip_t led_strip;
    static uint32_t _dma_buffer[144 * 4 * 2]; // count * type * 2
    const bc_led_strip_buffer_t _led_strip_buffer =
            {
                    .type = BC_LED_STRIP_TYPE_RGBW,
                    .count = 144,
                    .buffer = _dma_buffer
            };


    void stopEffect(void* param) {
        (void) param;
        bc_led_strip_effect_stop(&led_strip);
    }

    void application_init(void)
    {
        bc_module_power_init();
        bc_led_strip_init(&led_strip, bc_module_power_get_led_strip_driver(), &_led_strip_buffer);

        bc_led_strip_effect_theater_chase_rainbow(&led_strip, 100);
        bc_scheduler_register(stopEffect, NULL, bc_tick_get() + 3000);
    }
