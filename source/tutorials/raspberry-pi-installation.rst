Raspberry Pi Installation
#########################

************
Introduction
************

.. caution::

    If you already have Raspberry Pi with the original Raspbian distribution, go to the section :ref:`Setup on Original Raspbian <setup-original-raspbian>`.
    Or if you have OSMC, go to section Setup on OSMC

This document will guide you through installing Raspberry Pi. The tutorial is tested for Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B) but should also work for older Raspberry Pi 2.

.. note::

    Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable, single-board computer that is able to run Linux operating system.
    HARDWARIO uses this system to process sensor information, actuator control,
    decision logic for automation, data storage, or serve as a gateway to connect cloud services.

In the following procedure, we will install the **HARDWARIO Raspbian** Linux distribution.
Raspbian is the official and most widely distributed Linux distribution for Raspberry Pi.
HARDWARIO maintains a modified version of this distribution that facilitates some steps and includes pre-installed packages that are key to **HARDWARIO**.

.. important::

    After you flash SD card, connect Ethernet, Radio Dongle and only after that apply the power to Raspberry Pi.

************

- Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B)
- MicroSD card with a minimum capacity of 4 GB
- MicroSD Card Reader (+ optional SD Card Adapter)
- Ethernet cable
- Workstation or laptop
- Router (or LAN switch) with the DHCP server set up

- `HARDWARIO Raspian <https://github.com/hardwario/bc-raspbian/releases/latest>`_
- `balenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_

Flash
*****

#. Insert microSD card to reader in you computer
#. Open balenaEtcher you've downloaded
#. Select HARDWARIO Raspian which you also downloaded
#. Select insered SD card
#. Click flash
#. After flash insert microSD card to Raspberry Pi, **you have to connect Radio Dongle before applying power**.
   Then connect microUSB power adapter and Ethernet cable or use Wifi setup in next chapter

*********************
WiFi Setup (optional)
*********************

If you would not like to use ethernet cable, you can connect Raspberry Pi over your WiFi

#. Connect microSD card with HARDWARIO Raspbian to computer
#. Open boot section in your file explorer or Finder
#. Create file **wpa_supplicant.conf**
#. Edit file with next text, then save and insert microSD card back to Raspberry Pi:

.. code-block:: console
    :linenos:

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1

network={
    ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}

***************************
Connecting to HARDWARIO HUB
***************************

After Raspberry Pi boots up, use your computer's web browser and enter the Raspberry Pi ``IP`` address to open the HARDWARIO HUB webpage.
On Linux/macOS you can use ``hub.local`` address.

To find out Raspberry Pi IP you can follow :doc:`these instructions <raspberry-pi-login>`.

.. important::

    If Start pairing button is disabled and you cannot press it. Please make sure you first connect Radio Dongle and then apply the power to Rasberry Pi.
