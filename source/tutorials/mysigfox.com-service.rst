MySigfox.com Service

MySigfox.com is our online service, which acts as a bridge between Sigfox Backend and your server.
Customers who buy our `Sigfox Module <https://shop.hardwario.com/sigfox-module/>`_ with 3-years connectivity
can use this service to get data sent by their modules to Sigfox network. This service is free to use.

Communication between MySigfox.com and Sigfox Backend is encrypted.
Communication between MySigfox.com and your server depends on you.
We allow you to use Webhook URL without HTTPS protocol, but we strongly encourage you to use HTTPS only.

.. tip::

    You can get free trusted SSL certificate

    ...thanks to the `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_ initiative

**********************
Custom POST Parameters
**********************

Currently we do not allow to use your own POST parameters to be added to request send by MySigfox.com to your server.
If you need to somehow identify requests for particular Sigfox module, you have two options:

#. You can use *device* field from message body, which is available in every message sent to your server
#. Or you can add custom query string to the Webhook URL. For example, if your Webhook look like https://example.cz/endpoint,
   you can change it to https://example.cz/endpoint?foo=bar. This should deliver your messages without any problem (but adding your data in the process).

******************************
POST Request (message) Content
******************************

Every request we send to your server is JSON encoded message with Content-Type set to ``application/json``.

Body of request contains specific fields:

- *snr* - Signal Noise Ratio
- *device* - Device ID
- *rssi* - Received Signal Strength Indication
- *time* - time when the message was received by Sigfox network (in UNIX timestamp format)
- *data* - data sent by your device

********************
Testing MySigfox.com
********************
